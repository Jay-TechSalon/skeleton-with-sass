// Media Queries
//––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

// Note: The best way to structure the use of media queries is to create the queries
// near the relevant code. For example, if you wanted to change the styles for buttons
// on small devices, paste the mobile query code up in the buttons section and style it
// there.

// Larger than mobile
@media (#{$bp-larger-than-mobile}) {}

// Larger than phablet (also point when grid becomes active)
@media (#{$bp-larger-than-phablet}) {}

// Larger than tablet
@media (#{$bp-larger-than-tablet}) {}

// Larger than desktop
@media (#{$bp-larger-than-desktop}) {}


// Larger than Desktop HD
@media (#{$bp-larger-than-desktophd}) {}

// Sizing for the media queries!

// Skeleton uses media queries to serve its scalable grid, but also has a list of queries for convenience of styling your site across devices. The queries are mobile-first, meaning they target min-width. Mobile-first queries are how Skeleton's grid is built and is the preferrable method of organizing CSS. It means all styles outside of a query apply to all devices, then larger devices are targeted for enhancement. This prevents small devices from having to parse tons of unused CSS. The sizes for the queries are:

// Desktop HD: 1200px
// Desktop: 1000px
// Tablet: 750px
// Phablet: 550px
// Mobile: 400px
