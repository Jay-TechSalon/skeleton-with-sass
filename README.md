# skeleton-with-sass
Working with Skeleton: Responsive CSS to run SASS differently then with Grunt and Bower

*Currently to use the build, follow these instructions*
- install npm on your machine
- fork, clone, download this repo
- cd to the directory
- npm init

This will get your devDependencies 

**Next to compile your SCSS files**
In the terminal, type the following
`npm run compile:scss`

That should fire up the compiler and place it into the styles.css file!

Running a local server:
Head back to the terminal and add this code: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
Then in the Browser put this in: `localhost:8000`
